# 💡 SmartHome Lamp Controller

**Open-source IoT home automation — control every lamp in your home from your phone.**  
Built on ESP32, Flutter, and MQTT. Works locally, works remotely, works offline.

## What is this?

SmartHome Lamp Controller lets you control the lights in your home using a **mobile app** (iOS & Android) and **ESP32 microcontrollers** wired to your lamp circuits. Everything communicates over **MQTT** — a lightweight protocol designed for embedded devices.

- Turn lamps on/off individually or by room
- Dim lights with PWM brightness control
- Schedule automations (wake-up light, bedtime routine)
- Works **fully local** — no cloud required
- Optional **remote access** via encrypted cloud broker
- Compatible with **Home Assistant**

## Quick Start

### 1 — Flash the ESP32

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/iot-home-automation.git
cd iot-home-automation/firmware
```

Copy the example config and fill in your details:

```bash
cp include/config.example.h include/config.h
```

Edit `config.h`:

```cpp
#define WIFI_SSID      "YourNetworkName"
#define WIFI_PASSWORD  "YourPassword"
#define MQTT_HOST      "192.168.1.100"   // Your broker IP
#define MQTT_PORT      8883
#define MQTT_USER      "lamp_001"
#define MQTT_PASS      "your_device_password"
#define DEVICE_ID      "lamp_001"
#define ROOM           "living_room"
```

Flash with PlatformIO:

```bash
pio run --target upload
```

Or open in Arduino IDE and click **Upload**.

---

### 2 — Start the MQTT Broker

**With Docker (easiest):**

```bash
cd broker
docker compose up -d
```

**Manually on Raspberry Pi / Linux:**

```bash
sudo apt install -y mosquitto mosquitto-clients
sudo systemctl enable --now mosquitto
```

Test it works:

```bash
mosquitto_sub -h localhost -t "home/#" -v
```

---

### 3 — Run the Mobile App

Requirements: [Flutter SDK 3.x](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)

```bash
cd mobile
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

The app auto-discovers your broker on the local network via mDNS. No IP address needed.

---

## MQTT Topic Structure

```
home/{room}/{device_id}/command    →  App sends commands to ESP32
home/{room}/{device_id}/state      →  ESP32 reports current state
home/{room}/{device_id}/status     →  ESP32 online/offline (LWT)
```

**Command payload (App → ESP32):**

```json
{ "action": "set", "state": "ON", "brightness": 75 }
```

**State payload (ESP32 → App):**

```json
{ "state": "ON", "brightness": 75, "uptime": 3600, "rssi": -58 }
```

## Security

- TLS encryption on all MQTT traffic (port 8883)
- Username/password auth per device
- Per-device topic ACLs (devices can only publish their own state)
- Wi-Fi credentials stored in ESP32 NVS (not compiled into firmware)
- BLE pairing for initial provisioning only

See [Security Guide](docs/security.md) for full setup instructions.
